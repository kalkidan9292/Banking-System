**Banking Analytics EDA & Dashboard Project**

This project walks through an end-to-end banking analytics workflow using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to analyze customer behavior, assess banking risk, and present insights through an interactive dashboard.
--
-- **Problem Statement**
-- Develop a basic understanding of banking risk analytics and learn how data helps minimize lending risks.
-- Evaluate how customer income, deposits, loans, and financial behavior influence risk.
--
-- **What This Project Includes**
-- Clean and prepare banking data for analysis.
-- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.
-- Engineer features like income band (low, mid, high).
-- Import the dataset into MySQL and run SQL queries.
-- Connect Python to MySQL for structured data processing.
-- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers and KPIs.
--
-- **Dataset Overview**
-- Customer details: age, nationality, gender, occupation, relationship type.
-- Financial metrics: estimated income, deposits, loans, credit card balance, savings, checking accounts.
-- Relationship fields: advisor ID, banking relationship ID, number of credit cards, properties owned.
--
-- **Tools & Skills Used**
-- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for EDA.
-- SQL/MySQL: database setup, table creation, importing CSV files.
-- Power BI: page navigation, slicers, KPI cards, visuals, layout design.
-- Excel/CSV: initial data source format.
-- Statistics: correlation analysis, distributions, descriptive metrics.
--
-- **End-to-End Workflow**
-- Convert Excel file to CSV for easier processing.
-- Create a MySQL database and import the dataset.
-- Connect Python to MySQL using a SQL connector.
-- Explore data structure, shape, missing values, and data distribution.
-- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis of numeric and categorical variables.
-- Create categorical income bands for segmentation.
-- Build heatmaps for correlation between loans, deposits, and balances.
-- Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
-- Create Home, Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and Summary dashboard pages.
--
-- **Key Banking KPIs**
-- Total Loan = Bank Loan + Business Lending + Credit Card Balance.
-- Total Deposit = Bank Deposit + Savings Account + Checking Account + Foreign Currency Account.
-- Additional KPIs: Total Clients, Total Fees, Total CC Amount, Savings Balance.
--
-- **Dashboard Design Overview**
-- Home/Summary page with major KPIs and page navigation.
-- Loan Analysis page showing loans segmented by income, occupation, nationality, and relationship type.
-- Deposit Analysis page showing deposits, savings, checking, and foreign currency accounts.
-- Slicers for Year of Joining, Gender, Banking Relationship, and Advisor.
-- Background visuals designed in Canva for clean UI.
--
-- **Main Learning Outcomes**
-- Understand how a real analytics workflow is structured from raw data to insights.
-- Learn how to combine Python, SQL, and Power BI to build a portfolio-ready project.
-- Develop intuition around banking analytics, customer segmentation, and risk indicators.
