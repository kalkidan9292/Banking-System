-- # Banking Analytics EDA & Power BI Dashboard
-- 
- This project walks through an end-to-end banking analytics workflow using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.
-- The goal is to perform risk analytics for lending decisions and turn raw banking data into an interactive dashboard.
-- 
-- ## Problem Statement
-- 
-- Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services.
-- Use customer data to understand how banks can minimize the risk of losing money while lending.
-- Analyze different customer segments (high, medium, and low income) and their loan and deposit behavior.
-- 
-- ## What This Project Covers
-- 
-- Clean and prepare a banking dataset for analysis.
-- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, including univariate and bivariate analysis.
-- Engineer features such as income bands (low, mid, high) from estimated income.
-- Load the cleaned data into a MySQL database and connect it to Python via a SQL connector.
-- Use SQL for structured queries and data validation.
-- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard on top of the MySQL (or CSV) data source.
-- Design pages for loan analysis, deposit analysis, and a summary view for stakeholders.
-- 
-- ## Dataset Overview
-- 
-- Client attributes: age, location ID, year of joining the bank, nationality, occupation, and gender.
-- Financial attributes: estimated income, superannuation, savings, banking deposits, banking loans, credit card balance.
-- Relationship attributes: number of credit cards, banking relationship ID (retail, institutional, private, commercial), advisor IDs, properties owned, risk weighting.
-- Target use case: understand which types of customers are more risky or more profitable from a lending and deposit perspective.
-- 
-- ## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
-- 
-- Python: data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
-- SQL / MySQL: table creation, data loading from CSV, and querying for analysis.
-- Power BI: KPI cards, navigation buttons, slicers, and multi-page dashboard design.
-- Excel / CSV: initial format of the banking dataset before loading into MySQL.
-- Statistics: descriptive statistics and correlation analysis for numeric features.
-- 
-- ## End-to-End Workflow
-- 
-- 1. Convert the original Excel banking file into CSV.
-- 2. Import the CSV into MySQL and create a database and customer table.
-- 3. Connect Python to MySQL using a connector and read the data into a DataFrame.
-- 4. Inspect shape, data types, and missing values to validate data quality.
-- 5. Run descriptive statistics and univariate analysis on key numeric features.
-- 6. Analyze categorical features such as banking relationship, nationality, and occupation.
-- 7. Create new features like income band (low / mid / high) from estimated income.
-- 8. Build correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between deposits, loans, and account balances.
-- 9. Export or connect the cleaned data to Power BI.
-- 10. Design a multi-page dashboard (Home, Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, Summary) with slicers and KPIs.
-- 
-- ## Example KPIs
-- 
-- Total Loan = Bank Loan + Business Lending + Credit Card Balance.
-- Total Deposit = Bank Deposit + Savings Account + Checking Account + Foreign Currency Account.
-- Supporting KPIs: total clients, total fees, total credit card amount, savings and checking balances.
-- 
-- ## Dashboard Design
-- 
-- Home / Summary page with key KPIs and navigation buttons.
-- Loan Analysis page showing bank loans, business lending, and credit card balance by income band, segment, and nationality.
-- Deposit Analysis page showing deposits, savings, checking, and foreign currency accounts by segment and income band.
-- Slicers for year of joining, gender, banking relationship, and advisor.
-- Layout and visuals designed in Canva first, then implemented in Power BI.
-- 
-- ## Learning Focus
-- 
-- Show how real data analytics work is often split: EDA, data preparation, SQL modeling, and dashboarding.
-- Practice combining Python, SQL, and Power BI into a single portfolio project.
-- Build intuition for banking risk analytics and customer segmentation using real-world style data.
